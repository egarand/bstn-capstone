# üçÉüîç Hike & Seek

## Overview

Hike & Seek aims to encourage local exploration and responsible hiking, and foster an appreciation for users' local ecosystems by helping users find places for outdoor recreation and educating users about the wildlife they may find there.

## Installation

1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Create a new postgres database to store Hike & Seek's data
2. Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
3. Clone this repository and [the repository for the API](https://github.com/egarand/bstn-capstone-api)
4. For the front end repository (you are here):
    1. Copy `.env.sample`, rename it to `.env`, and make sure each variable is set how you need it. `VITE_API_URL` will need to match the port you set for the API.
    2. `npm install`
    3. `npm run dev`
5. For the API repository:
    1. Copy `.env.sample`, rename it to `.env`, and make sure each variable is set how you need it. Make sure the ones prefixed `DB_` match your local database set up.
    2. `npm install`
    3. `npm run db:migrate`
    4. `npm run db:seed`
    5. `npm run dev`

### Problem Space

Many individuals, particularly those in urban areas, experience a disconnect from natural spaces and a lack of knowledge about local ecosystems. This gap in understanding diminishes outdoor experiences and makes it hard to find those outdoor experiences to begin with. Unless you already know a good spot to hike or camp, it can be a struggle to find a place to go - and many small local hiking trails and campgrounds don't have an online presence, which makes them nigh-impossible for a beginner to find. Additionally, without knowledge of the kinds of wildlife they may encounter, an aspiring outdoorman misses valuable educational opportunities, and may even inadvertently harm wildlife or their habitats.

### User Profile

- Outdoor enthusiasts:
  - ...looking for a new spot to hike, camp, or unwind in nature close to their location
  - ...looking for spots to hike or camp close to a given location for the future
  - ...that want to keep track of trails, campgrounds, and nature reserves they want to visit
  - with a focus on beginners to these activities, though individuals of all experience levels are welcome.

### Features

- As a user, I want to be able to find trails and campgrounds close to my current location.
- As a user, I want to be able to find trails and campgrounds close to any given location.
- As a user, I want to learn about wildlife I can encounter at a given trail or campground.

  - Auth functionality will be added after core features have been implemented.
  - Add states for logged in that show different UI in relevant areas.

  - One user account, plus a few saved points of interest

- Feature: Home Page

## Future Implementations

- Improve UX around bookmarking; the location details page should inform a logged in user if this PoI is in their bookmarks already and allow them to unbookmark it.
- Optimize front-end API calls; implement a response caching system to reduce the number of calls made to the API, especially to proxy endpoints.
- Include a printable Sightings Checklist page that displays a formatted list of randomly selected species for a given location; intended for people to bring with them on a trip to see how many of those species they can spot.
- Improve UX around searching for locations; allow users to set the location by clicking the map, and by searching for an address.
- Improve parsing of OSM data to include more/more useful featured tags on locations.
- Get directions from a specified location to a given point of interest, when possible.
- Forgot password & password change functionality.
- Unit and Integration tests.
