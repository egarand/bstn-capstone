# üçÉüîç Hike & Seek

## Overview

Hike & Seek aims to encourage local exploration and responsible hiking, and foster an appreciation for users' local ecosystems by helping users find places for outdoor recreation and educating users about the wildlife they may find there.

### Problem Space

Many individuals, particularly those in urban areas, experience a disconnect from natural spaces and a lack of knowledge about local ecosystems. This gap in understanding diminishes outdoor experiences and makes it hard to find those outdoor experiences to begin with. Unless you already know a good spot to hike or camp, it can be a struggle to find a place to go - and many small local hiking trails and campgrounds don't have an online presence, which makes them nigh-impossible for a beginner to find. Additionally, without knowledge of the kinds of wildlife they may encounter, an aspiring outdoorman misses valuable educational opportunities, and may even inadvertently harm wildlife or their habitats.

### User Profile

- Outdoor enthusiasts:
  - ...looking for a new spot to hike, camp, or unwind in nature close to their location
  - ...looking for spots to hike or camp close to a given location for the future
  - ...that want to keep track of trails, campgrounds, and nature reserves they want to visit
  - with a focus on beginners to these activities, though individuals of all experience levels are welcome.

### Features

- As a user, I want to be able to find trails and campgrounds close to my current location.
- As a user, I want to be able to find trails and campgrounds close to any given location.
- As a user, I want to learn about wildlife I can encounter at a given trail or campground.
- As a user, I want to filter what iconic taxa (broad, well-known groups of wildlife) are displayed for each location.
- As a user, I want to be able to save or print a sightings checklist of wildlife from a location

- As a user, I want to be able to create an account to manage natural spaces I want to visit.
- As a user, I want to be able to login to my account to manage natural spaces I want to visit.

- As a logged in user, I want to be able to see wildlife available at my saved locations.
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to filter what iconic taxa are displayed for my saved locations.

### Auth

- JWT auth
  - Before adding auth functionality, relevant API requests will be made using a fake user with id 1.
  - Auth functionality will be added after core features have been implemented.
  - If user asks the site to remember them on login, JWT will be saved in localStorage; if not, it will be saved to sessionStorage; in either case, it is removed upon logout.
  - Add states for logged in that show different UI in relevant areas.
